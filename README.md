# exe-packager

Exe Packager is a one click application.
You just need to pass the absolute path of the file of which you want to create exe of.

considering all your dependencies it will create a shortcut of your executable file on desktop.

i deployed the brach on heroku by wrapping into a flask app.

How to use on local machine:

run EXE_Packager.py and install the required libraries

your executable will be generated and shortcut with all dependencies will be created at desktop for quick use.
